      We are [Brightly](http://wearebrightly.com), a Melbourne based indie pop band, combining elements of folk, pop and electronica.
      
      We love remixes, and remixing. So we’ve released all the stems for our tracks for you, the community, to do with what you will.

      All we ask is that you follow the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) license. That means you can share it, enjoy it, remix it and redistrbute it, as long as it’s non-commercial and anything you make with it is released under the same license.
